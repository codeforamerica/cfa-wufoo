WELCOME!

Hey friend! The files in this folder will help you to design CSS files
to further customize the look and feel of your Wufoo Forms. In this 
folder you'll find an HTML template of some Wufoo form markup, a blank 
CSS file for you to manipulate and an example CSS file to give you 
a jump start on the designing action.

WHO IS THIS FOR?

Advanced users and designers with knowledge of Cascading Style Sheets
that want to customize their Wufoo forms further than what is offered
by our home brew Wufoo Theme Builder.

THE FILES

index.html
README.html
/css/custom.css
/css/example.css

HOW TO USE

1. Edit the "custom.css" file to your liking. Check your work with the 
included "index.html" to see how it'll affect Wufoo form markup.

2. Upload the CSS file to **your own** web server.

3. Login to your Wufoo account and go to the Theme Builder.

4. Select the theme you want to use your custom CSS file with, select "Advanced" under your theme's properties, and enter the URL to the custom.css file on your web server.
